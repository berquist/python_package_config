* Python package configuration

These things really belong in a cookiecutter template (such as [[https://github.com/MolSSI/cookiecutter-cms/][cookiecutter-cms]]), but I'd rather just keep them together separately rather than maintain a template.

The main goals are that:
- [[https://pycqa.github.io/isort/][isort]] should first be used to handle imports.
- [[https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html][black]] should then be used to clean everything up.
- The remaining tools should not complain about things that black and isort handle automatically (specifically line length):
  - [[https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/][flake8]]
  - [[https://pylint.org/][pylint]]
